# EEPROM Promgrammer Client

A companion project to the [EEPROM programmer for Arduino and 2 shift registers](https://github.com/josefadamcik/EEPROMProgrammer). This is a client that will communicate with Arduino and 
allow you to program whole EEPROM memory with an Intel HEX file.

It's WIP.

Main purpose of this project is to exercise modern C++, GTest, GMock. I am certainly not a professional C++ developer.

## Dependencies
